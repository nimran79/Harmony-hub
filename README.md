Music recommendation System using PySpark

# Dataset
The dataset can be downloaded from here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vatsalmavani/spotify-dataset <br/>
Please make sure the 'path' variable is set to the root folder of the dataset. If you are using Google Colab, then you need to ensure the dataset folder is accessible to Colab engine.

# How to run the code
Please have the following libraries installed:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- PySpark

To install a specific library from Jupyter notebook directly, the following link is helpful:
- https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2017/12/05/installing-python-packages-from-jupyter/

Generally, Anaconda distribution is installed with most of these packages, so running Jupyter notebook from Anaconda is a good option.. 

### If you want to run using Google colab:

You can follow this link : https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/io.ipynb  <br/>
It contains all the instructions for importing directly from Github.

Otherwise, you can download the file "music_recommendation_system.ipynb" and upload it in Google Colab using the 'File->Upload Notebook' menu. Colab will automatically install all necessary packages. The free version of Colab is sufficient and this is the recommended way of running this code.
